        <h2>Description</h2>

        <!-- Brief History -->

        <p>
            Adopted from Indian cuisine, African bread known as chapati has been a part of East African cuisine for centuries.
            the East African recipe is slightly different from its Indian cuisine.
        </p>

        <p>
            This bread accompanies African soups and stews well. Preparation is minimal, making this a great choice for cooks in a pinch.
